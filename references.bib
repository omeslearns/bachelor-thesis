J Strength Cond Res 30(8): 2212–2218, 2016—A commercially available device claiming to be the world's first wearable lactate threshold predicting device (WLT), using near-infrared LED technology, has entered the market. The aim of this study was to determine the levels of agreement between the WLT-derived lactate threshold workload and traditional methods of lactate threshold (LT) calculation and the interdevice and intradevice reliability of the WLT. Fourteen (7 male, 7 female; mean ± SD; age: 18–45 years, height: 169 ± 9 cm, mass: 67 ± 13 kg, V[Combining Dot Above]O2max: 53 ± 9 ml·kg−1·min−1) subjects ranging from recreationally active to highly trained athletes completed an incremental exercise test to exhaustion on a treadmill. Blood lactate samples were taken at the end of each 3-minute stage during the test to determine lactate threshold using 5 traditional methods from blood lactate analysis which were then compared against the WLT predicted value. In a subset of the population (n = 12), repeat trials were performed to determine both inter-reliability and intrareliability of the WLT device. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) found high to very high agreement between the WLT and traditional methods (ICC {\textgreater} 0.80), with TEMs and mean differences ranging between 3.9–10.2\% and 1.3–9.4\%. Both interdevice and intradevice reliability resulted in highly reproducible and comparable results (CV {\textless} 1.2\%, TEM {\textless}0.2 km·h−1, ICC {\textgreater} 0.97). This study suggests that the WLT is a practical, reliable, and noninvasive tool for use in predicting LT in runners.},

Conventional methods for lactate determination are not accurate and fast so this accelerated the need of sensitive biosensors for high-throughput screening of lactate in different samples. This review focuses on applications and developments of various electrochemical biosensors based on lactate detection as lactate being essential metabolite in anaerobic metabolic pathway. A comparative study to summarize the L-lactate biosensors on the basis of different analytical properties in terms of fabrication, sensitivity, detection limit, linearity, response time and storage stability has been done. It also addresses the merits and demerits of current enzyme based lactate biosensors. Lactate biosensors are of two main types – lactate oxidase (LOD) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) based. Different supports tried for manufacturing lactate biosensors include membranes, polymeric matrices-conducting or non-conducting, transparent gel matrix, hydrogel supports, screen printed electrodes and nanoparticles. All the examples in these support categories have been aptly discussed. Finally this review encompasses the conclusion and future emerging prospects of lactate sensors.},

	abstract = {The reliability and accuracy of five portable blood lactate (BLa) analysers (Lactate Pro, Lactate Pro2, Lactate Scout+, Xpress™, and Edge) and one handheld point-of-care analyser (i-STAT) were compared to a criterion (Radiometer ABL90). Two devices of each brand of analyser were assessed using 22 x 6 mL blood samples taken from five subjects at rest and during exercise who generated lactate ranging {\textasciitilde}1-23 mM. Each sample was measured simultaneously {\textasciitilde}6 times on each device. Reliability was assessed as the within-sample standard deviation (wsSD) of the six replicates; accuracy as the bias compared with the ABL90; and overall error (the root mean squared error (√MSE)) was calculated as the square root of (wsSD(2) and bias(2)). The √MSE indicated that both the Edge and Xpress had low total error ({\textasciitilde}0-2 mM) for lactate concentrations {\textless}15 mM, whereas the Edge and Lactate Pro2 were the better of the portable analysers for concentrations {\textgreater}15 mM. In all cases, bias (negative) was the major contribution to the √MSE. In conclusion, in a clinical setting where BLa is generally {\textless}15 mM the Edge and Xpress devices are relevant, but for athlete testing where peak BLa is important for training prescription the Edge and Lactate Pro2 are preferred. Key pointsThe reliability of five common portable blood lactate analysers were generally {\textless}0.5 mM for concentrations in the range of {\textasciitilde}1.0-10 mM.For all five portable analysers, the analytical error within a brand was much smaller than the biological variation in blood lactate (BLa).Compared with a criterion blood lactate analyser, there was a tendency for all portable analysers to under-read (i.e. a negative bias), which was particularly evident at the highest concentrations (BLa {\textasciitilde}15-23 mM).The practical application of these negative biases would overestimate the ability of the athlete and prescribe a training intensity that would be too high.},

	abstract = {The adenosinetriphosphatase (ATPase) (EC 3.6.1.3) activity in Azotobacter vinelandii concentrates in the membranous R3 fraction that is directly associated with Azotobacter electron transport function. Sonically disrupted Azotobacter cells were examined for distribution of ATPase activity and the highest specific activity (and activity units) was consistently found in the particulate R3 membranous fraction which sediments on ultracentrifugation at 144 000 X g for 2 h. When the sonication time interval was increased, the membrane-bound ATPase activity could neither be solubilized nor released into the supernatant fraction. Optimal ATPase activty occurred at pH 8.0; Mg2+ ion when added to the assay was stimulatory. Maximal activity always occurred when the Mg2+:ATP stoichiometry was 1:1 on a molar ratio at the 5 mM concentration level. Sodium and potassium ions had no stimulatory effect. The reaction kinetics were linear for the time intervals studied (0-60 min). The membrane-bound ATPase in the R3 fraction was stimulated 12-fold by treatment wiTH TRypsin, and fractionation studies showed that trypsin treatment did not solubilize ATPase activity off the membranous R3 electron transport fraction. The ATPase was not cold labile and the temperature during the preparation of the R3 fraction had no effect on activity; overnight refrigeration at 4 degrees C, however, resulted in a 25\% loss of activity as compared with a 14\% loss when the R3 fraction was stored overnight at 25 degrees C. A marked inactivation (although variable, usually about 60\%) did occur by overnight freezing (-20 degrees C), and subsequent sonication failed to restore ATPase activity. This indicates that membrane reaggregation (by freezing) was not responsible for ATPase inactivation. The addition of azide, ouabain, 2,4-dinitrophenol, or oligomycin to the assay system resulted in neither inhibition nor stimulation of the ATPase activity. The property of trypsin activation and that ATPase activity is highest in the R3 electron transport fraction suggests that its probable functional role is in coupling of electron transport to oxidative phosphorylation.},

	abstract = {The crystal structure of cytochrome c peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.5) has been refined to an R factor of 0.20 computed for all reflections to 1.7 A. The refined molecular model includes 263 bound water molecules and allows for x-ray scattering by amorphous solvent. The mean positional error in atomic coordinates is estimated to lie between 0.12 and 0.21 A. Two factors are identified which may account for the ability of the enzyme to stabilize high-oxidation states of the heme iron during catalysis: 1) the proximal histidine forms a hydrogen bond with a buried aspartic acid side chain, Asp-235; and 2) the heme environment is more polar than in the cytochromes c or globins, owing to the presence of the partially buried side-chain of Arg-48 and five water molecules bound in close proximity to the heme. Two of these occupy the presumed peroxide-binding site. Two candidates are likely for the side chain that is oxidized to a free radical during formation of Compound I: 1) Trp-51, which rests 3.3 A above the heme plane in close proximity (2.7 A) to the sixth coordination position; and 2) Met-172, which is 3.7 A from the heme. Nucleophilic stabilization of the methionyl cation radical may be possible via Asp-235. His-181 is found to lie coplanar with the heme in a niche between the two propionates near the suspected cytochrome c-binding site. A network of hydrogen bonds involving this histidine may provide a preferred pathway for electron transfer between hemes.},

While the efficacy of CEA has been established, it is important to review the processes and outcomes of care to ensure high-quality, cost-effective care. As part of a quality-improvement process, our hospital's Vascular Surgery Quality Improvement Team redesigned the care for patients having CEA surgery. Practice changes, implemented in January 1995, included routine discharge on the first postoperative day; a new critical pathway supported by a computerized order set, a switch from general anesthesia to a regional block approach, and the use of an algorithm in treating postoperative hypertension. The impact of these changes on cost and quality were then analyzed. A retrospective chart audit was completed on 185 CEA surgeries performed in 1995. Length of stay decreased by 1.15 days, and costs were reduced by \$1900 per case, with no change in postoperative morbidity or mortality rates. The incidence and severity of postoperative hypertension, bradycardia, and hypotension were also analyzed, supporting the practice changes and the current level of nursing care.},
