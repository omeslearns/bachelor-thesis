Knowledge graphs have been leveraged in enterprise and open data  for more than a decade, but for personal use, they are just emerging. Most of the tools for personal knowledge graphs are based on proprietary tech and data formats. This Paper explores how data-centric PKGs can be modeled using Semantic Web Standards and how to create usability focused Interfaces for them.
